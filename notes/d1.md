1. Go over basic data structures.
  - Strings
  - Fixnum
  - Array
  - Hash

What do they have in common? What can you do with them? Why are they important?

2. Looping
  - `for`
  - `while`
  - `until`
  - Range looping
  - Enumerables

3. Blocks
  - What is a block?
  - How are they different from objects?
  - What can you do with them?

4. Syntax Best Practices
 - When to use `''` over `""` vice versa.
 - Different between Fixnum and Float
   - Fixnum arithmetic. What happens when you `1 / 2`
 - `Array.new` vs `[]`
 - `Hash.new` vs `{}`
 - When to use each loop.
 - `do end` vs `{}` blocks
 - Method and variable naming conventions.
