# Introduction

Throughout the course of this program, we'll be going over five different languages:
two object oriented (Javascript & Ruby), SQL, HTML, and CSS. We'll also be learning
an MVC (Model View Controller) framework in Rails as well as a front end
framework in React. We'll learn how to pull data from a database, manipulate the data,
and eventually send it as needed so we can display accordingly.

You might be unfamiliar with many of the terms above, but by the end of the program,
you'll have the knowledge to build an entire web app from scratch using these languages and frameworks.

# Mentorship

Mentorship generally describes the relationship between a mentor (someone who's experienced
or knowledgeable in a particular area) and a mentee (someone less experienced or younger).
The mentor typically guides and gives advice to the mentee but we'll take our mentorship a bit further
and say that I'll be almost a teacher at times.

This means that - though there will be a curriculum and there will be assignments to do
on a daily or weekly basis, you will be held responsible to your mentor as well as yourself
to learn independently and struggle through problems you might find difficult.

Know that this mentorship involves both of us putting in an equal amount of effort,
dedication, and work. If we're on the same page throughout the program, you'll be in
good shape.

# Schedule

You'll be putting a significant amount of time in per week throughout summer,
and we'll adjust that as school rolls by. For now, unless stated otherwise, the schedule
will start as: **Monday to Friday - 5 hours a day**. You're free to change that
schedule as you see fit. Just make sure we're putting in 25 hours a week.

# Blog

We're going to start a daily blog about your day's learning experienced. Each
post can be however long you want it, but should take no LESS than 10 minutes. Most
likely around a paragraph or two at minimum.

I'll be reading these from time to time!
